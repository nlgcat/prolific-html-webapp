# This is the webapp for hosting Prolific surveys for the Edinburgh Napier University lab within the reprohum project.

# Each interface has the following structure ${outputb1} where inside the brackets is the name of the variable.
# There can be multiple variables - which should be defined in the python code to match the variable names in the csv file.
